## Testing Locally

Open the website in your browser:
```powershell
cd build
start index.html
```

Or use the public folder during development:
```powershell
cd public
start index.html
```

## Troubleshooting

**If the website shows only the README:**
1. Make sure you run `npm run build` first
2. Commit and push all changes
3. Run `npm run deploy`
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

**If localStorage isn't working:**
- Make sure you're not in private/incognito mode
- Check browser console for errors

**If styles aren't loading:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + F5)
- Check that all files are in the build folder
